# D3RPC
Diablo 3 Discord Rich Presence

Quick and dirty way to get Discord's Rich Presence working with Diablo 3. You have to set everything up manually for now.
APIs are a hassle. Feel free to fork though.

**Installation**

>Just get the executable for either Windows or Linux in the releases tab.

you need python3 installed ~~until I compile this into an executable~~

# pip

*modules*
>- pip install tkinter
>- pip install pypresence

# Arch Linux

>- pacman -S tk
>- yay -S python-pypresence


*download *
the main branch source code and extract it to some folder

*running it*
open terminal in that folder, or cd into it and run python3 ./d3rpc.py

Feel free to add me on Discord or DM me here.
