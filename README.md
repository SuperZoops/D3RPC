# D3RPC
Diablo 3 Discord Rich Presence

Quick and dirty way to get Discord's Rich Presence working with Diablo 3. You have to set everything up manually for now.
APIs are a hassle. Feel free to fork though.

# Library Dependencies

**pip (Linux, Mac, Windows)**

>- pip install tkinter
>- pip install pypresence

**Arch Linux**
(It's not a great idea to mix in pip packages on Arch as nearly everything is on the AUR or normal repos already.)

>- pacman -S tk
>- yay -S python-pypresence

# Running

>- python3 d3rpc.py



# Things to add (Most likely won't ever happen)
>- always on top button
>- figure out how to pack the png background in executables
>- get actual blizzard's API working
>- connection status indicator


Thanks to Commando950 for helping me with the dictionary and connection check.
