# D3RPC
Diablo 3 Discord Rich Presence

Quick and dirty way to get Discord's Rich Presence working with Diablo 3. You have to set everything up manually for now.
APIs are a hassle. Feel free to fork though.

Installation

you need python3 installed until I compile this into an executable

modules
pip install tkinter
pip install pypresence

download 
the main branch source code and extract it to some folder

running it
open terminal in that folder, or cd into it and run python3 ./d3rpc.py

Feel free to add me on Discord or DM me here.
